I am deeply committed to continuous learning and teamwork, always striving to expand my skill set and enhance my contributions. During my internship, I broadened my expertise beyond Android by learning React and developing a fully functional consumer ordering website using React, Redux, and Saga. My adaptability and problem-solving skills have been evident in my seamless transition to a new tech stack, where I enthusiastically tackled challenges, consistently met deadlines, and delivered high-quality work. I actively seek feedback to improve further and ensure my growth aligns with organizational goals. As a collaborative team player, I contribute meaningfully to group efforts and build strong relationships across teams, fostering alignment with Verizon's overarching objectives and values.
