1. Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanisms
	•	Traffic Shaping & Prioritization: Assigns priority levels to different types of traffic (e.g., VoIP and emergency calls get higher priority than video streaming).
	•	Differentiated Services (DiffServ): Uses packet marking to classify traffic and prioritize critical applications.
	•	Class-Based Queuing (CBQ): Allocates bandwidth dynamically based on predefined traffic classes.

2. Network Slicing (5G-Specific)
	•	Dedicated Slices for Emergency Services: 5G enables slicing, where a separate high-priority “slice” can be allocated for critical communications.
	•	Dynamic Resource Allocation: AI/ML-based models adjust bandwidth in real time depending on network congestion and priority.

3. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
	•	Application-Aware Traffic Management: DPI can analyze data packets to differentiate emergency calls from social media usage and allocate bandwidth accordingly.
	•	Policy-Based Bandwidth Allocation: Based on real-time analysis, DPI can throttle low-priority traffic like YouTube while ensuring high-speed connectivity for 911 calls.

4. AI-Based Traffic Prioritization
	•	Predictive Traffic Management: AI models analyze user behavior to predict and allocate bandwidth dynamically.
	•	Anomaly Detection for Emergencies: AI can detect patterns indicating an emergency (e.g., multiple users in a stadium dialing emergency numbers) and prioritize network traffic accordingly.

5. Emergency Services-Integrated Priority Access (FirstNet, UK ESN, etc.)
	•	FirstNet (USA): A dedicated LTE network for first responders, ensuring they always have priority.
	•	Emergency Services Network (ESN) in the UK: Prioritizes emergency service communications over public network traffic.
